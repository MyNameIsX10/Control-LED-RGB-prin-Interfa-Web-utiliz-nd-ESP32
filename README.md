# Control LED RGB via Web Interface using ESP32

This project aims to control an RGB LED module through a web interface using an ESP32 microcontroller. It offers an intuitive and interactive solution for customizing lighting, allowing users to adjust the LED parameters in real-time.

## Key Features:

- **Brightness Control:** Users can adjust the RGB LED's brightness using an intuitive slider. It allows fine control of brightness with values ranging from 0 to 255, providing precise light intensity adjustments.

- **Color Change:** The interface includes an RGB selector, allowing users to choose a specific color for the LED. This enhances the user experience and allows complete customization of the lighting.

- **On/Off Functionality:** A dedicated button allows users to easily turn the LED on or off. This feature is useful for energy-saving and quick control over the lighting system.
